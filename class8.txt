class 8 - creating your own Docker  images

What is a Container?

A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes:

Application code

Runtime

Libraries

System tools

Containers share the host operating system’s kernel, unlike virtual machines that require a full OS.

Containers vs Virtual Machines
Weight and Performance

Containers are lightweight.

They do not bundle a full operating system.

Faster startup time and better resource utilization compared to VMs.

Isolation

Both containers and VMs provide isolation.

Containers use Linux namespaces and cgroups.

Virtual machines use hypervisors for isolation.

How Containers Work
Namespace Isolation

Linux namespaces isolate system resources such as:

Process IDs

Hostnames

Network access

User IDs

Inter-process communication

File systems

Control Groups (Cgroups)

Manage CPU, memory, and other resources.

Prevent one container from consuming all host resources.

Ensure fair resource distribution.

Docker’s Kernel Interaction

Docker interacts directly with the Linux kernel to manage containers efficiently.

Linux: Docker runs natively using the host kernel.

Windows and macOS: Docker uses a lightweight Linux virtual machine because these systems do not support the Linux kernel natively.

Running Containers on Different Systems

Linux: Native container execution.

Windows / macOS: Containers run inside a Linux VM.

Ephemeral Nature of Containers

Containers are ephemeral, meaning:

They can be created, stopped, and destroyed easily.

No persistent state is maintained by default.

Applications must be:

Stateless, or

Use external storage for persistence.

This design enables scalability and fault tolerance.

Port Mapping and Networking

Containers have isolated networking stacks.

Port mapping connects container ports to host ports.

Enables communication between host and containerized applications while maintaining isolation
