Class 4- Intro to Shell Scripting



 Commands in the snippet

mkdir test
Creates a new folder named test.


cd test/
Changes current directory to test.

echo "Learning in scaler" > scaler.txt

This command:
Prints the text Learning in scaler
Redirects it (>) into a file named scaler.txt
If the file does not exist, it is created
If it exists, it will overwrite the file
So now the folder test contains one file: scaler.txt.
4. Move back to home directory

cd ..
This goes one level up — out of the test directory.
5. List files

ls -a
Shows all files including hidden ones (-a shows files starting with .).
6. Try to remove the test directory

rmdir test
This fails, because:
rmdir can remove only empty directories
Output:
rmdir: failed to remove 'test': Directory not empty
7. Force delete the directory with its contents

rm -rf test
Meaning:
Flag	Description
-r	recursive (delete inside files/folders)
-f	force delete without asking confirmation
This deletes the test folder along with scaler.txt inside it


Operator	Meaning	Effect on existing file
>	Redirect + Overwrite	Deletes old content
>>	Redirect + Append	Preserves old content
