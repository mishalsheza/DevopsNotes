Docker & Containerization Notes

Docker = open platform
Build, ship, run apps
Separates app from infrastructure

Containers
Package app + dependencies
Runs same everywhere
Lightweight
Uses host OS kernel

Running Containers
docker run → start new container
docker run -it ubuntu bash → terminal access

Existing Container
docker exec → run commands in running container
docker exec -it <id> bash

Inspect Containers
docker ps → list running containers
docker container inspect <id> → details + IP

Docker Images
Images = templates
Container = running image

docker images → list images
docker commit → create new image

Docker Hub
Image repository
docker push <image>
Image name starts with username

Networking
Containers have IPs
Use inspect to find IP
Use curl to communicate

Dockerfile
Used to build images
Each step = new layer
Layers help caching

Detached Mode
docker run -d
Runs in background

Why Docker?
More efficient than VM
No full OS overhead
Fast & portable

Conclusion
Docker simplifies development
Improves consistency
Foundation for modern deployment
