Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform used to create, manage, and run containers.
It allows developers to package applications along with all their dependencies into a single standardized unit called a container.

Docker Philosophy: “If It Fits, It Ships”

The philosophy means that if an application works inside a Docker container, it will work anywhere Docker is installed.
Developers only need to ensure their code fits and runs correctly inside a container, without worrying about the target environment.

Key Concepts in Docker
Containers

Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that include:

Application code

Runtime

System tools

Libraries

Configuration files

Containers are similar to virtual machines but are more lightweight because they share the host system’s kernel while running in isolated user space.

Docker Images

Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers.
They contain the application and all required dependencies.
A container is a running instance of a Docker image.

Docker Daemon

The Docker daemon is a background service running on the host machine.
It listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker components such as:

Containers

Images

Networks

Volumes

Docker Client

The Docker client is a command-line interface (CLI).
It allows users to send commands to the Docker daemon.
The client and daemon can run on the same machine or communicate remotely.

Volumes and Networking
Volumes

Volumes provide persistent storage for Docker containers.
They ensure that data is not lost when containers are stopped or deleted.
Volumes are commonly used for databases and other stateful applications.

Networking

Docker provides built-in networking capabilities.
It allows containers to communicate with each other and with external systems.

Working with Docker
Running Docker Containers

Docker containers are started using the docker run command.
Interactive containers use:

-i for interactive mode

-t for terminal access

This allows users to access the container shell directly.

Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository for Docker images.
It is the default source for pulling Docker images.
Users can push, pull, and share images with others.
