Class 7 - Docker images

Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform that helps automate the deployment, management, scaling, and operation of application containers.
The class focused on Docker fundamentals such as image creation, Dockerfiles, and essential commands for container management.

Key Concepts
Docker Images and Containers

Docker Image

A packaged environment containing everything required to run an application.

Includes code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

Acts as the blueprint for creating containers.

Images are the building blocks of containers.

Docker Container

A running instance of a Docker image.

Similar to a virtual machine but more lightweight.

Uses the host system’s kernel, making it faster and more efficient.

Basic Docker Commands
Docker Build

Used to create Docker images from a Dockerfile.

Common option:

-t to assign a name (tag) to the image.

Image tags should always be in lowercase.

Docker Run

Used to start a container from a Docker image.

Common options:

-d for detached (background) mode.

-p for port mapping between host and container.

Dockerfile Essentials

A Dockerfile is a script containing instructions used to build a Docker image.

Important Dockerfile Commands

FROM

Specifies the base image.

Acts as the starting point for image creation.

RUN

Executes commands during the image build process.

Each RUN instruction creates a new image layer.

Poor use can increase image size and reduce performance.

CMD

Defines the default command executed when the container starts.

Can be overridden using command-line arguments.

ENTRYPOINT

Defines the main command for the container.

Cannot be overridden easily like CMD.

Advanced Concepts
Multi-stage Builds

Used to reduce final image size.

Keeps only required components in the production image.

Improves performance and security.

Copy-On-Write (CoW) Mechanism

Loads only required layers at runtime.

Improves efficiency and reduces memory usage.

Performance Optimization Strategies
Reducing Image Layers

Fewer layers result in better performance.

Combine multiple RUN commands using &&.

Base Image Optimization

Choosing the correct base image is crucial.

For Java applications:

Use JDK during build.

Use JRE in production to reduce image size.

Practical Example

Java application built using multi-stage Docker builds.

First stage uses JDK to compile the application.

Final stage uses JRE for a smaller production image.

Tools and Environment

Docker environment setup was demonstrated.

Students practiced building images, running containers, and deploying applications.

Emphasis was placed on hands-on learning.
