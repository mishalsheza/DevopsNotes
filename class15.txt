Class 15 - Understanding Kubernetes services

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of machines.

It abstracts infrastructure details and allows developers to focus on application logic rather than server management.

2. Pods

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
It represents a single running process in the cluster.

Key Features of Pods

A pod can contain one or more containers

All containers in a pod:

Share the same IP address

Share the same port space

Share storage volumes

Containers communicate with each other using localhost

Characteristics

Co-located: Containers run on the same node

Co-started: Containers start and stop together

Shared Networking: One IP per pod

Analogy

A pod is like a house, and containers are rooms inside it.
The house has one address (IP), not the individual rooms.

3. ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of identical Pods are running at all times.

Why ReplicaSets?

If a pod crashes → a new pod is created automatically

Ensures fault tolerance

Enables horizontal scaling

Key Points

Works even for a single pod

Kubernetes continuously compares:

Desired state vs actual state

If mismatch occurs → corrective action is taken

4. Deployments

A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and Pods.

Capabilities

Declarative updates

Scaling applications up or down

Rolling updates (zero downtime)

Rollbacks to previous versions

Deployments are the recommended way to run stateless applications in Kubernetes.

5. Services

Pods are ephemeral (they can die and be recreated), so their IPs change.
A Service provides a stable network endpoint to access pods.

Types of Services
ClusterIP

Default service type

Accessible only within the cluster

NodePort

Exposes the service on a static port on each node

Automatically creates a ClusterIP internally

Core Functions

Service Discovery using labels

Load Balancing traffic across pods

Analogy

Like multiple ticket counters in a cinema — users can go to any counter and still get served efficiently.

6. Load Balancers

Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple pods.

Types

Internal Load Balancer: Used inside the cluster

External Load Balancer: Exposes services to the internet (cloud-based)

They ensure:

High availability

Even traffic distribution

7. YAML Files in Kubernetes

Kubernetes resources are defined using YAML configuration files.

Core Sections of YAML

apiVersion – API version being used

kind – Type of Kubernetes object (Pod, Deployment, Service)

metadata – Name, labels, namespace

spec – Desired state of the object

Understanding YAML is essential for declarative Kubernetes management.
