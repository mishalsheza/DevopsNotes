Class 2 - Intro to Devops


1. Overview of DevOps

What is DevOps?
DevOps = Dev + Ops
Set of practices + tools + culture
Goal → faster & reliable software delivery

Brings Development and Operations together
Improves collaboration and automation

2. Challenges in DevOps
Biggest challenge → cultural change
Teams resist new workflows
Needs mindset shift & teamwork

3. Key Concepts in DevOps

DevOps Philosophy
Breaks silos between development and operations teams.
Encourages automation and ownership across teams.

Shift Left Approach
Testing and security are introduced early in the development lifecycle.
Helps identify bugs and vulnerabilities sooner.
Reduces cost and effort of fixing issues later.

4. Security Testing in DevOps

Types of Security Testing
SAST
Checks source code
No execution needed

DAST
Checks running application
Finds runtime vulnerabilities

SCA
Scans third-party libraries
Detects known vulnerabilities

Example of Code Vulnerability
SQL injection is a common vulnerability.
Using Statement in Java can allow injection attacks.
Using PreparedStatement helps prevent SQL injection by safely handling inputs.

5. Continuous Integration (CI)

CI Pipeline Steps
Code checkout
Install dependencies
Linting
Build application
Run unit tests
Security checks (SAST + SCA)
Create artifacts (Docker / binaries)
Deploy to staging

6. Continuous Deployment (CD)

After CI success
Deployment automated
Manual stop only on failure
Fast & frequent releases

7. Communication and Coordination in DevOps

API Gateway
Acts as a single entry point for client requests.
Handles routing, authentication, and throttling.

Microservices Communication
Synchronous communication is real-time and blocking.
Asynchronous communication is non-blocking and event-driven.
Message brokers like RabbitMQ and Kafka are commonly used.

8. Conclusion
DevOps integrates development, operations, testing, and security.
It improves collaboration, automation, and delivery speed.
Overall, DevOps increases efficiency and software reliability.
