class 10 - Docker volume

Docker networking enables communication:

Between containers

Between containers and the host

Between containers and external networks

It is a core concept for running distributed and microservice-based applications in Docker.

2. Key Concepts in Docker Networking
IP Addresses

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
In Docker:

Each container gets a unique IP address within its Docker network

Containers use these IPs to communicate with each other

Subnetting

Subnetting divides a large network into smaller networks.

Uses CIDR notation (e.g., /24)

CIDR defines how many bits belong to the network

Example:
192.168.10.0/24

Total bits = 32

Host bits = 32 − 24 = 8

Total IPs = 2⁸ = 256

Network ID and Broadcast ID

Network ID: First IP address in a subnet (identifies the network)

Broadcast ID: Last IP address (used to send messages to all devices)

These addresses cannot be assigned to hosts.

3. Docker Zero Bridge (docker0)

When Docker is installed, it creates a default virtual bridge called docker0.

Acts like a virtual network switch

Connects containers to each other and to the host

Each container has:

An eth0 interface

A virtual Ethernet connection (veth pair) to docker0

4. Docker Network Setup
Default Bridge Network

By default, containers run on the docker0 bridge

Containers can communicate using IP addresses

Example:

docker run -d nginx


Starts an Nginx container inside the default bridge network.

Custom Bridge Networks

Custom networks provide:

Better isolation

Automatic DNS-based container name resolution

Create a custom bridge network:

docker network create -d bridge my_bridge


You can also define:

Subnet

Gateway

IP range

Container Communication

Containers in the same network can communicate directly

Docker handles routing via virtual bridges

Communication can happen via:

IP addresses

Container names (in custom networks)

5. Practical Subnetting Example

A larger network can be split into smaller ones:

Engineering: 192.168.10.0/26

HR: 192.168.10.64/26

Reception: 192.168.10.128/26

Each /26 subnet provides:

64 IP addresses

Better isolation between departments

6. Troubleshooting Docker Networking

Useful command:

docker inspect <container_name>


Helps to:

View container IP address

Check network mode

Debug connectivity issues
