Introduction to CI/CD
What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
It is a modern software development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.
The objective is to integrate code changes frequently and deploy them reliably with minimal manual effort.

Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration ensures that every code change is automatically validated.

CI Workflow

Code is pushed to a version control repository.

An automated pipeline is triggered.

Stages in CI

Linting
Checks code quality and syntax errors.
Helps identify issues early before the build stage.

Build
Downloads required dependencies.
Compiles and packages the application.

Unit Testing
Tests individual components of the application.
Mocking is used to simulate external dependencies.

Security Checks

SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Detects vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Analyzes source code for security issues without executing it.

Artifacts in CI

Artifacts are the outputs generated during the build process.
They are stored and reused during deployment.

Examples of Artifacts

JAR, WAR files

Executables (.exe)

Gems

Docker images

Artifacts ensure consistency between CI and CD stages.

Containers and Docker
Dockerization

Docker packages an application along with its dependencies into containers.
This ensures the application runs consistently across different environments.

Docker Images

Static, immutable artifacts.

Built using a base image with additional layers.

Layer caching speeds up the build process.

Pushing Docker Images

Docker images are pushed to an artifact repository.
This enables version control, sharing, and reuse across environments.

Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment automates the release of applications after CI.

Deployment Pipeline

Deployment starts from stored artifacts.

Can be a separate pipeline or an extension of CI.

Reduces manual intervention and release delays.

System Integration Testing (SIT)

First environment where the complete application is deployed.

Tests interaction between different system components.

Validates end-to-end functionality.

IP Addressing in Deployment
Public IP

Assigned temporarily to instances.

Changes when an instance is stopped or restarted.

Not ideal for production environments.

Elastic IP

Fixed IP address.

Remains unchanged across restarts.

Suitable for production deployments requiring stable endpoints.
