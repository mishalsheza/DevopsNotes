class 12 - Deep dive into kubernetes pods

Kubernetes works on a cluster-based architecture consisting of multiple machines (nodes).

Types of Nodes

Master Node (Control Plane)
Responsible for managing the cluster and making decisions such as scheduling and maintaining desired state.

Worker Nodes (Data Plane)
Execute application workloads (pods) assigned by the master node.

In the class demonstration:

Three machines were used

One was configured as the master

Two were configured as worker nodes

2. Setting Up the Master Node

Before the session, necessary installations were prepared.

Initialization Process

Root access was taken using:

sudo su


The Kubernetes master node was initialized using:

kubeadm init

What Happens During Initialization

Kubernetes downloads and configures essential components such as:

API Server

etcd

Controller Manager

Scheduler

Required YAML manifests are automatically set up

The cluster control plane becomes operational

3. Understanding Pods
What is a Pod?

A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes

It can contain one or more containers

Key Characteristics of Pods

Co-located
Containers in a pod share:

Network namespace

Storage volumes

Co-scheduled
All containers in a pod always run on the same node

Pods act as a logical wrapper around containers.

4. Kubernetes Architecture Overview
Control Plane

Manages the cluster and maintains the desired state.

Includes:

API Server – Central communication hub

etcd – Key-value store for cluster data

Controller Manager – Ensures desired state

Scheduler – Assigns pods to worker nodes

Data Plane (Worker Nodes)

Responsible for running applications.

Includes:

Application pods

Kubelet

Networking components

5. API Server and kubectl
kubectl

Command-line tool used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster

Sends requests to the API Server

API Server Responsibilities

Authentication

Authorization

Validation of requests

Communication with etcd to store or retrieve cluster state

The API server acts as the single entry point for all cluster operations.

6. Hands-On Deployment
Creating and Managing Pods

The instructor demonstrated:

Creating pods using kubectl

Monitoring pod status using commands such as:

kubectl get pods


Understanding basic kubectl commands is essential for:

Debugging

Monitoring

Managing workloads

7. Namespaces in Kubernetes
Purpose of Namespaces

Logical isolation of resources

Better organization of large clusters

Default Namespaces

default

kube-system

kube-public

Namespaces help separate system components from user applications.

8. Networking Configuration
CoreDNS

Handles DNS resolution inside the Kubernetes cluster

Allows pods to communicate using service names

Network Plugins

Required for pod-to-pod communication

Example: Weave

Without a network plugin, pods cannot communicate properly

9. Scheduling and Resource Allocation

Kubernetes schedules pods based on:

Available CPU

Available RAM

If a node does not have sufficient resources, pods will remain in Pending state
