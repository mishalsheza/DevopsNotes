class 9 - Docker Containers

1. Introduction to Docker Volumes

Docker Volumes are a Docker-managed mechanism for persistent storage.
They store data outside the container lifecycle, ensuring data is not lost when containers stop, crash, or are removed.
Volumes can be shared and reused across multiple containers, making them ideal for real-world applications.

2. Importance of Docker Volumes

Containers are temporary by nature, but applications often need permanent data storage.
Docker volumes:

Preserve data across container restarts

Decouple application logic from storage

Improve data reliability and management

Are essential for stateful applications like databases

3. Core Concepts
Ephemeral Nature of Containers

Containers are designed to be short-lived.
When a container is removed, all data inside it is lost unless stored externally using volumes.

Writable Layer in Containers

Each container has a writable layer on top of the image layers.
Changes are stored here while the container runs.
If the container is deleted, this writable layer is also deleted → data loss without volumes.

4. Types of Docker Storage
Named Volumes

Created and managed by Docker

Have user-defined names

Reusable across containers

Stored under:

/var/lib/docker/volumes/


Best option for production use

Anonymous Volumes

Automatically created by Docker

No user-defined name

Not easily reusable

Usually used temporarily

Bind Mounts

Direct mapping to a host filesystem path

Full control over file location

Requires manual permission and path management

Less portable than volumes

5. Use Cases
Database Persistence

Databases running in containers must retain data even if containers fail.
Volumes ensure database files remain intact across container restarts or recreation.

Shared Data Between Containers

Multiple containers can mount the same volume.
Useful for:

Microservices sharing configuration or files

Logs or shared assets

Collaboration between containers

6. Volume Management Commands
Create a Volume
docker volume create <volume_name>


Creates a Docker-managed named volume.

Inspect a Volume
docker volume inspect <volume_name>


Displays volume metadata, including host storage location.

Attach Volume to a Container
docker run -v <volume_name>:<container_path> <image_name>


Mounts the volume inside the container at the specified path.

Read-Only Volume
docker run -v <volume_name>:<container_path>:ro <image_name>


Mounts the volume in read-only mode, preventing data modification
