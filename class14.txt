class 14 - Deep dive into Kubernetes Deployments


 Pod

Smallest unit in Kubernetes

Runs one app instance

Contains 1 or more containers

Ephemeral (can die anytime)

ReplicaSet

Ensures N pods always running

Pod crashes? -> new pod created

Node dies? -> pod rescheduled

Focus = availability

Deployment 

Manages ReplicaSets

Adds superpowers 

Rolling updates

Rollbacks

Version history

Best way to deploy apps in K8s

 Deployment YAML

Same as ReplicaSet YAML

Just change:

kind: Deployment

Scaling

Increase users? -> increase replicas

Less traffic? -> reduce replicas

Simple & dynamic

 Rolling Updates

Default behavior

No downtime 

Old pods replaced one-by-one

 Rollback

New version breaks? 

Roll back instantly ⏮

Kubernetes keeps revision history

Best Practices

✔ Use YAML (declarative)
✔ Store configs in Git
✔ Use namespaces
✔ Avoid manual prod changes
✔ Always monitor desired vs actual state

 One-Line Memory Trick

Deployment = ReplicaSet + Rolling Updates + Rollbacks
